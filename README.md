# EMPLOYEE-TRACKER
## **Description**
This is an application that will ask various promots in order to build a table displaying  various Employee information. This can output Employee Name, Role, Department, Manager and also can remove, update, and insert various data through mySQL.

This was a fun, yet time consuming project. The biggest challange I faced was the SQL syntax. It is so easy to miss a common, a capitaliztion, and even a word!
